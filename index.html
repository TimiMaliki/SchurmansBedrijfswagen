                    Dodge is an American brand of automobiles and a division of Stellantis North America, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

                    Plymouth was a brand of automobiles produced by Chrysler Corporation and its successor DaimlerChrysler. 
                    The brand was launched in 1928 to compete in what was then described as the "low-priced" market segment that was dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. It became a high-volume seller for the automaker until the late 1990s. Plymouth cars were marketed primarily in the United States.
                     The brand was withdrawn from the marketplace in 2001. The Plymouth models that were produced up to then were either discontinued or rebranded as Chrysler or Dodge.

                   The family business that preceded the current Peugeot companies was founded in 1810,[6] is regarded as the oldest car company in the world.
                   On 20 November 1858, Émile Peugeot applied for the lion trademark.
                    <br>
                    The car and motorcycle company and the bicycle company parted ways in 1926, but the family-owned Cycles Peugeot continued to build bicycles throughout the 20th century until the brand name was sold off to unrelated firms. 
                    The family-owned firm Peugeot Saveurs continues to make and market grinders and other kitchen and table-service equipment.

                    Plymouth was a brand of automobiles produced by Chrysler Corporation and its successor DaimlerChrysler. 
                    The brand was launched in 1928 to compete in what was then described as the "low-priced" market segment that was dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. It became a high-volume seller for the automaker until the late 1990s. Plymouth cars were marketed primarily in the United States.
                    The brand was withdrawn from the marketplace in 2001. The Plymouth models that were produced up to then were either discontinued or rebranded as Chrysler or Dodge.
